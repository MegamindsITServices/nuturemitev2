# Cash on Delivery Order Bug Fix

## Issue
When attempting to place a Cash on Delivery order, the following error occurred:
```
Error creating order: Error: Order validation failed: totalPrice: Path `totalPrice` is required.
```

## Root Cause
The `totalPrice` field is required in the Order model, but was either:
1. Not being properly passed from the frontend
2. Not being properly parsed as a number
3. Incorrect import of the paymentService (default vs named export)

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Frontend Fixes
- Fixed import statement for paymentService (changed from default import to named import)
```javascript
// Before
import paymentService from '../../services/paymentService';
// After
import { paymentService } from '../../services/paymentService';
```

- Added explicit number parsing for totalPrice
```javascript
totalPrice: parseFloat(totalAmount) // Ensure totalPrice is a number
```

- Added console logging for better debugging
```javascript
console.log('Sending COD order data:', orderData);
```

- Improved error handling with more specific error messages
```javascript
if (error.message?.includes('totalPrice') || errorMsg?.includes('totalPrice')) {
  toast.error('Error with order total: Please try again');
  setPaymentError('There was an issue with the order amount. Please try again or contact support.');
}
```

### 2. PaymentService Fixes
- Added validation to ensure totalPrice is properly set
```javascript
if (!orderData.totalPrice || isNaN(orderData.totalPrice)) {
  console.error('Invalid totalPrice:', orderData.totalPrice);
  throw new Error('Total price is required and must be a number');
}
```

- Added better error logging and token handling
```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('auth') ? JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('auth')).token : null;
const headers = token ? { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` } : {};
```

### 3. Backend Fixes
- Added additional validation in the createOrder controller
```javascript
if (req.body.totalPrice === undefined || isNaN(req.body.totalPrice)) {
  console.warn("Invalid totalPrice received:", req.body.totalPrice);
  console.warn("Request body:", JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    success: false, 
    message: "Invalid total price provided. Must be a number.", 
    receivedValue: req.body.totalPrice,
    valueType: typeof req.body.totalPrice
  });
}
```

- Ensured totalPrice is parsed as a float in the controller
```javascript
totalPrice: parseFloat(totalPrice) // Ensure totalPrice is a number
```

- Improved error response to include the actual error message
```javascript
return res.status(500).json({ 
  message: "Internal server error",
  error: error.message
});
```

## Testing
To test this fix:
1. Add items to your cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Select "Cash on Delivery" as the payment method
4. Complete all required fields
5. Click on "Place Cash on Delivery Order"
6. Verify that the order is created successfully

## Additional Notes
- If issues persist, check the browser console for more detailed error information
- Verify that the totalPrice is being sent as a number in network requests
- Check that the `payment` object structure matches what the server expects
